            Born in Brazil, Ted Wallace came to Belgium at a young age to build a new life. This very personal and intercultural experience defines his architectural work today. Having faced multiple challenges to achieve his goals and ambitions, his passion for architecture has led him to where he stands today. After graduating with a Master of Interior Architecture at St. Lucas - University of Leuven - he has gained experience for several years at one of Belgium's top architecture firms. 

          </p>
<p class="text-justify">
            He is especially interested in reinterpreting architectural minimalism in light of his tropical roots and weaving intercultural references into his design. Using noble materials with clean forms, he always seeks to combine the sensuality of Brazilian architecture with the rationality of Belgian architecture to craft an elegant style of his own. 

</p>
<p class="text-justify">
            As such, he reflects on creating spaces of living that hold the warmth of his native country with the hospitality of his new one. In an intercultural and multidisciplinary way, he thinks out of the box crossing both the boundaries of his discipline and the borders of two continents.

<p class="text-justify mb-3">
            Architecture and design for him is a way of expressing his odyssey in creating spaces that one can call 'home' ...

<p>
wherever one happens to find oneself in the world.
